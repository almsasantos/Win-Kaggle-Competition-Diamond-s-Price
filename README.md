# Project Module III: How to Win Kaggle's Competition - Predict Diamond's Price

## Goal

The goal of this portfolio is to help you win kaggle's competition by having the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) possible. With this code I reached a RMSE value of 514$ and consequently won the competition.
It's almost impossible to get a value below that dollar quantity because diamond's price depends on a lot of variables as you'll see explained on the jupyter-notebook file.


## How it works

- Open the folder 'jupyter-notebook', you'll find a file called 'Kaggle_Competition.ipynb' to see how I resolve the competition.
- Both train and test datasets are available on the data folder.
